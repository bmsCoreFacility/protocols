# Protocols
This workspace contains protocols used in the BMS Core Facility. The protocols found here are tested in our facility and are working as written. We often update the protocols to improve certain aspects or based on the availability of reagents, so check back often to make sure you are using the most recent version.

If you have a question or issue with any of the protocols found here, please create an issue so we can address it.


**FOR ALL PROTOCOLS** - refer to the health and safety guidelines of your own institute, as well as the MSDS documents for the described chemicals before use. Some of the chemicals and objects used are dangerous and should be handled with caution.
